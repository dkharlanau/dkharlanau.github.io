  - id: clean-core-governance
    title: "Keep S/4HANA clean and portable"
    summary: "Design extensibility so that in-app customising, side-by-side build, and partner systems remain interchangeable without vendor lock-in."
    commitments:
      - "Classify each requirement across in-app, in-stack, and side-by-side options with a portability score."

  - id: observability-always-on
    title: "Observability as a contract"
    summary: "Every process and integration change ships with monitoring, runbooks, and prevention analytics."
    commitments:
      - "Define golden signals (e.g., order stuck, IDoc backlog, cash application delay) alongside each change request."
      - "Deploy health dashboards and alert thresholds before the solution goes live."
      - "Feed incidents back into KEDB, playbooks, and automation backlog within 48 hours."

    summary: "AI copilots support teams with retrieval, context, and approval flows that satisfy compliance and accountability."
    commitments:
      - "Document datasets, prompts, and retention before piloting any AI workflow."
      - "Keep humans-in-the-loop for critical decisions and surface explainability in UX or runbooks."
      - "Measure adoption, accuracy, and drift monthly; retire use cases that cannot meet guardrails."
    proof_points:
      - "Delivered AMS assistant that halved triage time with documented retention and redaction patterns."
      - "Automated pricing simulations with AI review steps approved by compliance officers."
