    Programmes rarely fail because of one module. Cash slips, logistics bottlenecks, and data debt stack up until nobody trusts the numbers &mdash; <span class="hero-highlight">I reset the guardrails without halting the business.</span> As a system analyst and SAP transformation consultant with 12+ years across Order-to-Cash, logistics, and data, I reboot clean-core S/4HANA, make integrations observable, and deliver automation teams adopt.

      body: >-
        European automotive supplier had 210 monthly SAP order-to-cash incidents despite green SLAs. Ticket closure times looked fine, yet 37% were repeats and backlog age crept past nine days. We rebuilt AMS as a knowledge engine: clustered incidents, codified a KEDB, added interface heartbeats, and automated the top five IDoc/AIF reprocessing patterns. Ops leads co-authored playbooks in Confluence, and weekly prevention stand-ups tracked backlog age, MTTR, and repeat rate. Within two quarters MTTR dropped 42%, repeat tickets fell 58%, and backlog age returned to under three days. Finance signed off on a €1.4M annual run-rate saving because returns credits no longer stuck in SD billing, and two AMS FTE shifted into automation delivery.
    - title: "Clean core S/4HANA composable ERP guardrail"
      body: >-
        Global retail group prepping an S/4HANA carve-out faced 180+ Z-programs touching SAP SD pricing and partner integrations. Clean core guardrails were missing, and 60% of ADRs lived in inboxes. We ran a composable ERP review: catalogued every enhancement, re-homed probabilistic flows into sidecar services, and introduced contract tests for SAP Integration Suite Event Mesh and API gateways. Within three sprints the backlog shrank by 45%, shadow pricing simulations moved to a serverless sidecar, and we cleared 74 unreleased transports without delaying the cutover. Exit-test scenarios proved the estate portable, and licence projections signalled €900k savings over three years by swapping two niche add-ons for open runtimes.
    - title: "AI/ML sidecar lifts OTIF and working capital"
      body: >-
        North American chemicals business struggled with late deliveries: OTIF sat at 71% and planners triaged 14 spreadsheets nightly. Audit traced 62% of misses to missing supply signals and opaque BP data quality. We ran a process diagnostics sprint, built an event-driven digital twin, and launched an AI sidecar predicting late shipments with 82% precision. The team wired alerts into Teams, wrapped corrections in a Temporal workflow, and added MDG validators with BP/CVI governance (bp/cvi governance) gates to stop bad partners entering the system. Within 90 days OTIF climbed to 89%, repeat escalations dropped 51%, and working capital exposure fell by $8.6M from faster invoicing. Compliance approved the setup because every model run logged prompts, datasets, and human approvals.
