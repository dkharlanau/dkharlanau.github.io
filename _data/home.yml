  lead: >-
    Go-live is complete, but results remain unclear: cash is still delayed, costs keep rising, and the same problems appear again and again or never get solved. AMS no longer inspires trust, and the financial impact that was promised is still missing &mdash; <span class="hero-highlight">it shouldn&rsquo;t be this way.</span> As a SAP SD consultant (sap sd consultant) and O2C stabilisation (o2c stabilisation) lead, I rebuild clean core s/4hana guardrails so incidents drop, integrations stay observable, and automation pays back fast.

      body: >-
        European automotive supplier had 210 monthly SAP order-to-cash incidents despite green SLAs. Ticket closure times looked fine, yet 37% were repeats and backlog age crept past nine days. We rebuilt AMS as a knowledge engine: clustered incidents, codified a KEDB, added interface heartbeats, and automated the top five IDoc/AIF reprocessing patterns. Ops leads co-authored playbooks in Confluence, and weekly prevention stand-ups tracked backlog age, MTTR, and repeat rate. Within two quarters MTTR dropped 42%, repeat tickets fell 58%, and backlog age returned to under three days. Finance signed off on a €1.4M annual run-rate saving because returns credits no longer stuck in SD billing, and two AMS FTE shifted into automation delivery.
    - title: "Clean core S/4HANA composable ERP guardrail"
      body: >-
        Global retail group prepping an S/4HANA carve-out faced 180+ Z-programs touching SAP SD pricing and partner integrations. Clean core guardrails were missing, and 60% of ADRs lived in inboxes. We ran a composable ERP review: catalogued every enhancement, re-homed probabilistic flows into sidecar services, and introduced contract tests for SAP Integration Suite Event Mesh and API gateways. Within three sprints the backlog shrank by 45%, shadow pricing simulations moved to a serverless sidecar, and we cleared 74 unreleased transports without delaying the cutover. Exit-test scenarios proved the estate portable, and licence projections signalled €900k savings over three years by swapping two niche add-ons for open runtimes.
    - title: "AI/ML sidecar lifts OTIF and working capital"
      body: >-
        North American chemicals business struggled with late deliveries: OTIF sat at 71% and planners triaged 14 spreadsheets nightly. Audit traced 62% of misses to missing supply signals and opaque BP data quality. We ran a process diagnostics sprint, built an event-driven digital twin, and launched an AI sidecar predicting late shipments with 82% precision. The team wired alerts into Teams, wrapped corrections in a Temporal workflow, and added MDG validators with BP/CVI governance (bp/cvi governance) gates to stop bad partners entering the system. Within 90 days OTIF climbed to 89%, repeat escalations dropped 51%, and working capital exposure fell by $8.6M from faster invoicing. Compliance approved the setup because every model run logged prompts, datasets, and human approvals.
