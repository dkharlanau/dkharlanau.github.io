    <h1>Answering high-frequency SAP O2C objections</h1>
    <p class="lead">When stakeholders question AMS value, platform choices, or AI enablement, these responses make the economics and guardrails clear.</p>

      <h2>How do you reduce O2C incidents if SLAs are already green?</h2>
      <p>We pivot from patching to prevention: build a KEDB, codify playbooks, and wire observability packs across interfaces. With backlog age, repeat-rate, and MTTR tracked weekly, we cut noise and redeploy capacity into automation.</p>

    <article class="faq-item neub-card">
      <h2>Do you force SAP BTP for every extension?</h2>
      <p>No. Clean core S/4HANA stays sacred, but the edge remains composable. We adopt BTP when it clearly wins on capability or economics; otherwise, we run open runtimes with portable contracts so exit costs stay low.</p>

    <article class="faq-item neub-card">
      <h2>How do you keep AI/ML initiatives auditable around SAP?</h2>
      <p>AI lives side-by-side: retrieval-first patterns, feature stores, and human-in-loop approvals. We log prompts, datasets, and retention rules so compliance trusts the result and operators keep full control.</p>
