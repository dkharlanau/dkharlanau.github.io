## Introduction
The cv-ai platform is designed as a Jekyll-based static site with a modular architecture that supports extensibility while maintaining simplicity and performance. The system leverages structured data in YAML format, component-based templating, and AI-friendly JSON exports to create a professional portfolio that can evolve with growing content needs. This document outlines recommended patterns for extending the platform with new collections, integrating with headless CMS backends, expanding structured data models, and adding new features while preserving the core architectural principles of clarity, maintainability, and AI accessibility.

## Adding New Collections
To extend the platform with new content types such as case studies or playbooks, follow the established pattern of the existing notes collection. The system uses Jekyll collections defined in `_config.yml` to manage different content types with consistent output and permalink structures.

Create a new collection by adding it to the collections section in `_config.yml` with output enabled and a permalink pattern that follows the established convention. For example:

```yaml
collections:
  notes:
    output: true
    permalink: /notes/:slug/
  case_studies:
    output: true
    permalink: /case-studies/:slug/
  playbooks:
    output: true
    permalink: /playbooks/:slug/
```

Each collection should have a corresponding directory (e.g., `_case_studies`, `_playbooks`) containing Markdown files with front matter that includes at minimum title, date, and summary fields. The layout for new collections should follow the pattern of `_layouts/note.html`, which provides a consistent structure with header metadata, content body, and optional further reading sections.

Collection defaults in `_config.yml` ensure consistent application of layouts and metadata across all items in the collection, reducing configuration overhead and maintaining design consistency.

## CMS Integration Strategy
The platform can be extended to integrate with a headless CMS by mapping the `_data/home.yml` file to a backend content management system. This approach maintains the current presentation layer while enabling collaborative content editing and workflow management.

Implement CMS integration by creating a build-time synchronization process that fetches content from the headless CMS API and generates the `_data/home.yml` file during the site build process. The synchronization script should map CMS content types to the existing YAML structure, preserving the hierarchical organization of hero, services, and LLM profiles sections.

This pattern allows content editors to work within a familiar CMS interface while preserving the performance benefits of static site generation. The build process ensures that only approved content is published, and version control is maintained through the generated YAML file.

For real-time previews, implement a development mode that bypasses the static data file and connects directly to the CMS API, allowing content authors to see changes immediately without requiring a full site rebuild.

## Expanding Structured Data with Schema.org
As content grows, the platform can be enhanced with additional Schema.org entities to improve discoverability and enable richer AI interactions. The current implementation already leverages Article and Person schemas, but can be extended to include Projects, CaseStudies, and other relevant types.

To add new Schema.org entities, update the structured data templates in `_includes/seo/structured-data.html` to detect the collection type and render appropriate schema markup. For example, case studies could use the CaseStudy type with properties like outcome, methodology, and impact metrics, while playbooks could use the CreativeWork type with step-by-step instructions.

The datasets in `_data/datasets.yml` should be updated to include new content types as Dataset entities, following the existing pattern of defining distribution endpoints, keywords, and access rights. This ensures that all content is discoverable through the AI catalog and can be consumed by external agents.

When adding new schema types, maintain consistency with the existing data model by reusing common properties like creator, license, and keywords, and by following the same URL and ID patterns for entity references.

## AI Exports and Data Catalog Management
The platform's AI surface can be expanded by creating new JSON exports for additional content collections and updating the data catalog in `ai/catalog.json`. Each new collection should have a corresponding JSON endpoint in the `/ai` directory that exposes the structured data in a machine-readable format.

Create AI exports by adding new files to the `/ai` directory with null layouts and permalinks that follow the established naming convention (e.g., `case-studies.json`, `playbooks.json`). These files should use Jekyll's jsonify filter to transform the collection data into JSON format, similar to the existing `ai/resume.json` implementation.

The data catalog in `ai/catalog.json` should be updated to include new datasets with appropriate metadata including name, URL, license, and keywords. This ensures that AI agents can discover and access the new content through a single entry point.

Automate catalog maintenance by implementing a build script that scans the `/ai` directory and updates the catalog.json file with new datasets, reducing the risk of inconsistencies between available exports and catalog entries.

## Feature Expansion Roadmap
The platform can be enhanced with several key features to improve usability and functionality:

**Search Functionality**: Implement client-side search by generating a search index during the build process that includes content from all collections and data files. The index can be stored as a JSON file in the `/ai` directory and queried using a lightweight JavaScript search library.

**Analytics Integration**: Add privacy-conscious analytics by implementing a modular tracking system that can integrate with various providers. Use data attributes in templates to mark trackable elements, allowing analytics scripts to be added or removed without modifying content.

**Multilingual Support**: Extend the platform to support multiple languages by organizing content into language-specific directories and adding language metadata to the site configuration. Implement hreflang tags in the structured data to help search engines understand language relationships.

**Enhanced Sitemaps**: Expand the sitemap generation in `bin/build_static_sitemap.py` to include new content types and provide more detailed metadata about content freshness and priority, improving SEO and content discovery.

Each new feature should be implemented as a modular component that can be enabled or disabled through configuration, preserving the option to maintain a minimal footprint when needed.

## Architectural Considerations
When extending the system, maintain performance and simplicity through several key architectural principles:

**Build-Time Processing**: Prefer build-time generation over client-side rendering to maintain fast load times and reduce browser processing requirements. Generate static HTML, JSON, and sitemap files during the build process rather than at runtime.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Implement new features as progressive enhancements that do not break core functionality when disabled. This ensures the site remains usable even if JavaScript fails to load or is disabled.

**Content-First Design**: Maintain the content-first approach by ensuring that all new features enhance rather than obscure the primary content. Avoid adding UI elements that compete with the main content for attention.

**Performance Budgets**: Establish performance budgets for new features, limiting JavaScript payload size and third-party dependencies to maintain fast load times, especially on mobile networks.

**Cache-Friendly Architecture**: Design extensions to work well with CDN caching by minimizing dynamic content and using cache-friendly URL patterns and HTTP headers.

These considerations ensure that the platform remains fast, reliable, and accessible as new features are added.

## Backward Compatibility and Versioning
To ensure backward compatibility when introducing new features, follow a structured versioning approach:

**URL Stability**: Maintain stable URLs for existing content by using permanent redirects when changing permalink structures. Document URL mappings to ensure search engines and external links continue to resolve correctly.

**Schema Evolution**: When modifying data structures, support both old and new formats during a transition period. Use versioned endpoints (e.g., `/ai/v1/resume.json`) for breaking changes while maintaining legacy endpoints for a defined deprecation period.

**Configuration Defaults**: Set sensible defaults for new configuration options to ensure the site continues to build successfully when upgrading without requiring immediate configuration updates.

**Deprecation Policy**: Implement a clear deprecation policy that provides advance notice of upcoming breaking changes, documented in a changelog and communicated through release notes.

**Testing Strategy**: Maintain a comprehensive testing strategy that includes automated checks for build success, URL resolution, and schema validity to catch compatibility issues before deployment.

This approach allows the platform to evolve while minimizing disruption to existing users, integrations, and SEO performance.
