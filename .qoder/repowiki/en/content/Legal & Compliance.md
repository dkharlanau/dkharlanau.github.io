## Introduction

The cv-ai site establishes a comprehensive legal and compliance framework designed to foster trust, transparency, and accountability in professional consulting relationships. This framework encompasses six core policy documents that collectively define the operational standards, ethical guidelines, and technical responsibilities governing the site's interactions with clients, partners, and AI systems.

The legal framework serves multiple audiences: individual clients seeking consulting services, AI agents accessing machine-readable data, and the broader professional community interested in responsible technology practices. Each policy document addresses specific compliance requirements while maintaining consistency in tone, scope, and enforcement mechanisms.

## Legal Framework Overview

The legal framework consists of six interconnected policy documents that establish a cohesive compliance ecosystem:
