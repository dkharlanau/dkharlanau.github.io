## Introduction

This document outlines the privacy practices and data handling procedures for the cv-ai site, a personal professional portfolio and consulting platform hosted at https://dkharlanau.github.io. The site is designed to be transparent, minimal, and compliant with global privacy standards including GDPR and CCPA. No personal data is actively collected from visitors unless explicitly provided through external engagement channels. This policy explains how visitor interactions are handled, what data may be logged by hosting providers, and how users can exercise their privacy rights.

## Data Collection Practices

The cv-ai site does not employ any active data collection mechanisms such as web forms, cookies, or analytics scripts. Visitor data is not captured or stored by the site itself. The only potential data collection occurs indirectly through the hosting provider, GitHub Pages, which may log standard server log information including IP addresses, browser type, and request timestamps for security and operational purposes. These logs are not used for tracking or profiling and are governed by GitHub’s privacy policies.

No personal information is collected automatically as a result of browsing the site. The site does not use JavaScript-based analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) or any third-party tracking services.

## Hosting and Infrastructure

The site is built using Jekyll, a static site generator, and hosted on GitHub Pages. As a static site, it does not rely on server-side processing, databases, or dynamic content generation. All content is pre-rendered into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at build time. Because there is no backend logic or server-side execution, there is no opportunity for data processing or storage on the application level.

GitHub Pages serves the site globally via a content delivery network (CDN), and GitHub may retain access logs for operational and security purposes. These logs are subject to GitHub’s [Data Protection Addendum](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-data-protection-addendum) and are not accessible to the site owner beyond aggregated traffic metrics available through the GitHub repository insights.

## Form Submissions and Contact Channels

The site does not include any embedded contact forms or data submission interfaces. When users wish to engage, they are directed to external platforms such as LinkedIn or Calendly via hyperlinks. Any information submitted through these third-party services is governed by their respective privacy policies, not by this site.

For professional inquiries related to EPAM Systems projects, data handling follows EPAM’s internal privacy policies and contractual obligations. The site owner does not collect, store, or process personal data from visitors through any direct means.

## Third-Party Integrations

There are no embedded third-party scripts, widgets, or advertising technologies on the site. Social media links and professional network references are plain HTML hyperlinks that do not load external content or tracking pixels. The only integrations are navigational and do not involve data sharing at page load time.

When users click on external links (e.g., to LinkedIn, X, or Hashnode), they are redirected to those platforms, which may have their own data collection practices. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of those services before engaging.

## AI-Ready Data Exports

The site provides machine-readable versions of the owner’s professional profile in JSON and YAML formats under the `/ai/` directory (e.g., `/ai/resume.json`, `/ai/principles.json`). These files contain publicly shared professional data such as work experience, skills, and consulting principles. They are intended for use by AI systems, recruiters, or automation tools that wish to parse the information programmatically.

Users who incorporate these files into their systems are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy and data protection regulations. The data is provided "as-is" and is explicitly marked for public use.

These AI-ready assets are included in the sitemap and are accessible to crawlers, reflecting the site owner’s commitment to transparency and machine readability.

## Cookie and Tracking Policy

The cv-ai site does not use cookies, local storage, or any client-side tracking mechanisms. There are no tracking scripts, pixels, or fingerprinting technologies deployed. Visitors are not profiled, and no behavioral data is collected.

Any logging that occurs is limited to GitHub Pages infrastructure logs, which may include IP addresses and request metadata for security and abuse prevention. These logs are not used for user identification or tracking.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since the site does not collect personal data from visitors, there is no retention of visitor information. The only retained data relates to professional communications initiated through external channels (e.g., LinkedIn messages or Calendly bookings), which are managed separately and retained for up to 24 months for continuity of engagement, unless earlier deletion is requested.

Documentation from paid consulting work is stored within EPAM Systems’ or the client’s data governance framework and is subject to their retention policies.

Users may request deletion of any personal data held about them by contacting the site owner via LinkedIn or EPAM support channels.

## User Rights and Compliance

This site complies with major privacy regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Users have the right to:

- Access any personal data held about them
- Request correction of inaccurate information
- Request deletion of their data
- Object to or restrict processing
- Receive data in a portable format

To exercise these rights, users may contact the site owner directly via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkharlanau) or through EPAM Systems support. Requests will be responded to within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal and contractual obligations.

If a user believes their data has been mishandled, they are encouraged to report the issue immediately for resolution.

## SEO, Sitemap, and robots.txt

The site includes standard SEO and discovery files to ensure transparency and accessibility for search engines and AI crawlers:

- **robots.txt**: Explicitly allows all user agents to crawl the site, including AI bots such as GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and Google-Extended. This reflects the intent to make professional content widely available for indexing and learning.
- **sitemap.xml**: Dynamically generated using Jekyll’s sitemap plugin, it lists all public pages, their last modification dates, and update frequencies to aid search engine indexing.
- **Structured Data**: SEO metadata is included via the `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin, providing schema.org markup for better search visibility.

These files support ethical AI training and knowledge discovery while maintaining full compliance with privacy principles.

## Policy Accessibility

The Privacy Notice is publicly accessible at `/legal/privacy/` and is linked in the site footer for transparency. It is written in clear, straightforward language to ensure accessibility to all users. The policy is reviewed periodically and updated as needed to reflect changes in technology or regulations. The latest version is always available on the site.

The footer also includes links to related policies such as Terms of Engagement, Professional Disclosure, and Code of Conduct, ensuring comprehensive transparency.
