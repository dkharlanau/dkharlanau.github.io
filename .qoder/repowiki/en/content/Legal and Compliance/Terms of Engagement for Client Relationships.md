## Introduction

This document establishes the contractual framework and service expectations governing client engagements initiated through the cv-ai platform. It defines the terms under which Dzmitryi Kharlanau provides SAP consulting services, either independently or through EPAM Systems, ensuring clarity, accountability, and mutual protection. The scope encompasses consulting, audit, implementation, and training services, with reference to professional credentials documented in `resume.yml` and project portfolio data as evidence of capability. Engagement initiation is formalized through `connect.md`, while legal integrity is reinforced by alignment with `code-of-conduct.md` and `professional-disclosure.md`. Together, these documents form a complete legal ecosystem for professional service delivery.

## Scope of Work and Deliverables

Each engagement begins with a written statement of work (SOW) or proposal that explicitly defines objectives, deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria. The SOW serves as the foundational agreement, ensuring both parties share a common understanding of project goals and success metrics. Any changes to scope, timeline, or budget require mutual written approval to prevent scope creep and maintain alignment. During discovery phases, prototype or advisory artefacts may be produced; however, these are not considered production-ready unless explicitly stated in the SOW. This ensures clients understand the maturity level of early outputs and avoids misinterpretation of proof-of-concept work as final solutions.

## Service Offerings: Consulting, Audit, Implementation, and Training

The cv-ai platform supports four primary service modalities, each tailored to distinct client needs:

- **Consulting**: Strategic guidance on SAP O2C, logistics, integration, and clean core S/4HANA transformations. Focuses on process optimization, system resilience, and long-term TCO reduction.
- **Audit**: Comprehensive assessment of existing SAP landscapes, including incident management maturity, interface stability, data governance, and compliance posture. Delivers actionable roadmaps for improvement.
- **Implementation**: End-to-end execution of enhancements, integrations, or process extensions, leveraging event-driven and domain-driven design principles. Includes testing, cutover leadership, and post-go-live support.
- **Training**: Capability-building sessions on SAP SD, MDG, AIF monitoring, ABAP debugging, and LLM-assisted development. Designed for both functional and technical teams.

These offerings are informed by 12+ years of experience documented in `resume.yml`, including expertise in ABAP, Python, Dart/Flutter, and AI-augmented prototyping.

## Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria

Deliverables vary by engagement type but typically include functional specifications, technical designs, integration blueprints, test plans, training materials, and operational documentation. For audit services, deliverables include risk logs, decision records, and improvement backlogs. All deliverables are subject to formal acceptance criteria defined in the SOW. Clients are expected to designate a primary stakeholder empowered to review outputs and provide timely feedback. Weekly progress updates, backlog visibility, and shared documentation ensure transparency and reduce the risk of misalignment.

## Timelines and Project Milestones

Project timelines are established in the SOW and may follow time-and-materials, milestone-based, or fixed-fee models depending on the nature of the engagement. Milestone-based engagements include clearly defined checkpoints with associated deliverables and review periods. Progress is tracked through regular updates, risk logs, and backlog transparency. Any delays or blockers are communicated immediately, along with mitigation strategies or revised plans. This proactive approach ensures predictability and enables early course correction.

## Payment Terms and Invoicing

Pricing models are agreed upon prior to engagement commencement and may include time-and-materials, milestone-based, or fixed-fee structures. Invoices are issued according to the payment schedule outlined in the SOW and are payable within 30 calendar days unless otherwise specified. Expenses are billable only when pre-approved and supported by valid receipts. For engagements conducted through EPAM Systems, EPAM’s master services agreement governs financial terms, including invoicing and payment conditions.

## Intellectual Property Rights

Final deliverables, including documentation, code, and configurations created specifically for the client, become the client’s property upon full payment, subject to any third-party licensing terms. Reusable accelerators, frameworks, methodologies, or tools developed prior to or independently of the engagement—such as ABAP debugging scripts, AIF monitoring utilities, or LLM-assisted prototyping templates—remain the intellectual property of Dzmitryi Kharlanau or EPAM Systems. Clients receive a non-exclusive license to use these assets within the context of the agreed solution, ensuring continuity without compromising ownership of proprietary assets.

## Confidentiality Agreements

Both parties are obligated to protect confidential information shared during the engagement, including business data, system configurations, and personal information. Confidential data must be used solely for project purposes and safeguarded using appropriate technical and organizational measures. These obligations persist beyond the conclusion of the engagement. When working through EPAM Systems, EPAM’s data protection policies and client-specific security requirements apply, including MFA, device hardening, and least-privilege access controls.

## Dispute Resolution Mechanisms

In the event of a dispute, both parties commit to resolving issues through good-faith negotiation and documented communication. For direct engagements, disputes are governed by the laws of the European Union member state where services are rendered. For EPAM-led engagements, the dispute resolution clause in the EPAM contract takes precedence. Liability is limited to direct damages up to the total fees paid for the engagement and excludes indirect or consequential losses, ensuring reasonable risk allocation.

## Client Engagement Initiation via connect.md

Clients initiate engagements through the `connect.md` page, which serves as the official gateway for collaboration. This page outlines available engagement modes, including fractional leadership, SAP O2C programme support, and integration work. It provides access to partnership calls via LinkedIn and directs clients to EPAM Systems for enterprise-scale engagements. The `connect.yml` configuration defines engagement options and response channels, ensuring a structured and transparent intake process. This digital handshake formalizes the initial contact and sets the stage for SOW development.

## Legal Protections for Both Parties

The terms of engagement provide balanced legal protections. Clients benefit from clear scope definitions, acceptance criteria, and IP transfer upon payment. Consultants are protected through defined liability limits, pre-approved expense policies, and non-solicitation clauses. The non-solicitation agreement prohibits either party from hiring the other’s personnel involved in the engagement for 12 months post-completion, unless mutually agreed. Additionally, EPAM Systems’ governance frameworks apply when engagements are contracted through the company, adding an additional layer of institutional protection.

## Integration with Code of Conduct and Professional Disclosure

This document is part of a broader legal and ethical framework. It integrates with `code-of-conduct.md`, which establishes standards for client trust, ethical delivery, collaboration etiquette, and security compliance. It also aligns with `professional-disclosure.md`, which clarifies employment status, affiliations, conflict management, and communication protocols. Together, these documents ensure transparency about professional roles, prevent conflicts of interest, and uphold ethical standards in all client interactions. Technology recommendations are based on programme fit, not commercial incentives, and no referral fees or vendor commissions are accepted.
