    "name": "Exaggeration / Extremes (often used in OTSM-TRIZ trainings)",
    "definition": "Deliberately exaggerate a parameter (very high/very low) to reveal hidden constraints and new solution paths."

  "inputs": {
    "target_parameter": "The variable tied to the contradiction (e.g., 'lead time', 'validation strictness', 'cost').",
    "extreme_directions": [
      "make it 10× bigger",
      "make it near-zero"
    ]
  },
  "procedure": [
    "Pick one parameter that matters most.",
    "Run two extremes:",
    "  - Extreme A: 'What if this parameter is 10× bigger?'",
    "  - Extreme B: 'What if this parameter is ~0 (almost eliminated)?'",
    "For each extreme, answer:",
    "  - What breaks first?",
    "  - What must be removed or added to survive?",
    "  - What new constraints appear?",
    "Translate extreme insights back into realistic solutions (often these become Separation-on-Condition or new architecture boundaries)."
