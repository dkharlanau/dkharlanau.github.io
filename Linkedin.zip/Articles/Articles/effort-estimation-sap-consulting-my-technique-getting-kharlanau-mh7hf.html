  <div><p>As an SAP consultant with over 10 years of experience, one question I hear from clients all the time is: <strong>“How long will this take?”</strong> Whether it’s a simple enhancement or a full custom development project, <strong>clients want to know exactly how many hours or days it will take (!)</strong>. </p><p>Over the years, I’ve developed my own technique to estimate effort, and it’s not just about throwing out a number—it’s about understanding the project, the risks, and even the quirks of the people involved.</p><p></p><h3>Why Accurate Effort Estimation Matters</h3><p>In SAP consulting, effort estimation is more than just a rough guess—it’s a key part of project planning. Clients need <strong>solid estimates to plan their budgets, allocate resources, and set deadlines</strong>. Underestimating can lead to rushed, stressful work and disappointed clients. Overestimating can make you look inefficient or scare the client away. My technique is designed to strike the right balance and give clients a realistic picture of what to expect.</p><p></p><h3>My Technique: Break It Down</h3><p>I don’t believe in guessing. Instead, I break the project down into <strong>smaller, manageable tasks</strong>. For example, if a client needs a custom ABAP development, I’ll break it down like this:</p><ol><li><p>Understanding requirements</p></li><li><p>Writing technical specs</p></li><li><p>Development (<strong> and here one more SPLIT per components </strong>) </p></li><li><p>Unit testing</p></li><li><p>Client feedback and adjustments</p></li><li><p>Final testing and documentation</p></li></ol><p>By breaking the work into clear steps, I can assign<strong> time estimates to each part.</strong> This makes it easier to spot potential risks or challenges upfront. It also helps when explaining to the client exactly where the time is going.</p><p></p><h3>Accounting for the Team: Not Everyone Works the Same</h3><p>If I’m working on a project with a team, I also factor in the <strong>dynamics of the people involved</strong>. Not everyone works at the same pace. Some team members<strong> might get stuck on a problem or like to make frequent changes</strong>. Others might be faster but may require extra reviews to ensure quality.</p><p>I build these factors into my estimate, <strong>considering how each person’s working style might impact the timelin</strong>e. </p><blockquote><p>The goal is to make sure there’s enough time for everyone to do their part without slowing down the project.</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Tackling the Unknowns</h3><p>In SAP projects, one of the biggest challenges is the <strong>unknowns</strong>. Each system has its own quirks, and there are always surprises—whether it’s a<strong> hidden custom config </strong>or an <strong>undocumented process</strong> that turns a simple task into something more complicated.</p><p>That’s why I add a <strong>buffer</strong> to every estimate. Depending on how well I know the system and how much uncertainty there is, I’ll add anywhere<strong> from 20% to 60% extra time to cover these surprises</strong>. It’s better to have a cushion than to get blindsided by unexpected issues.</p><p></p><h3>Handling Scope Creep</h3><p>Clients love to add “just one more thing” once a project is underway. It’s called <strong>scope creep</strong>, and if you’re not careful, it can derail your whole timeline.</p><p>To avoid this, I make sure to clearly define the scope upfront and <strong>lock it in</strong>. Any changes or additional requests are treated as separate tasks with new estimates. This keeps things clear and helps prevent those extra tasks from snowballing into delays.</p><p></p><h3>Fixed vs. Floating Estimates</h3><p>Clients often ask for a <strong>fixed estimate</strong>—a set number of hours or days, no matter what happens. While this seems simple, it can be risky. Development rarely goes exactly as planned, and fixed estimates don’t leave room for the unexpected.</p><p>Instead, I prefer a <strong>floating estimate</strong>. I’ll say something like, “This will take between 30 and 50 hours.” This gives the client a realistic window and allows flexibility if things don’t go perfectly. Clients appreciate the honesty, and it helps manage expectations better than locking into a fixed number.</p><p></p><h3>Using Historical Data to Refine Estimates</h3><p>I’ve kept track of how long various projects and tasks take over the years, which gives me an edge when estimating new work. For example, if I’ve done a similar ABAP report in the past, I can look back at how long it took and use that as a baseline.</p><p>By drawing on this <strong>historical data</strong>, I can provide more informed estimates that clients can trust.</p><hr><h2>How I Improve Estimation Accuracy</h2><p>Over the years, I’ve picked up a few tricks to get better at estimating effort in SAP projects. Here’s what works for me:</p><ul><li><p>Estimating a whole project at once? Forget it. Break it down into small tasks. The smaller the task, the easier it is to estimate accurately. Plus, it helps you spot potential bottlenecks early.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I always check how long similar tasks or projects took in the past. History doesn’t lie, and having that data lets me make better predictions. If you’ve done something before, use it as a reference.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>If you’re not working alone, make sure to check with your team. One person might be faster, another might take longer. Knowing everyone’s working style helps you plan for hiccups.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>SAP projects are full of surprises. That’s why I always add a buffer—10% to 30%, depending on the complexity. It’s a safety net for when things don’t go as planned (which they rarely do).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Scope creep is a killer. To avoid it, I make sure the scope is crystal clear before we start. Any changes mid-project? They get a new estimate. No surprises, no stress.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>If things are going off track, don’t wait until it’s too late. I update the client as soon as something changes. Keeping them in the loop builds trust and helps manage expectations.</p></li></ul></div>
