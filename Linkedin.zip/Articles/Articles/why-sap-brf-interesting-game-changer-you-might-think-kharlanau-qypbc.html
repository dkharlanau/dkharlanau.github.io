  <div><p>I've been working with SAP since 2013, and over the years, I’ve encountered many tools that promise to make life easier. <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DECISION_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT/90c77b45fd0f42febd69eea239037688/9a6b67ce7c26446483af079719edf679.html" target="_blank">SAP Business Rule Framework Plus (BRF+)</a> is one of those tools. </p><p>During one of my projects, I got to dive deep into BRF+, migrating complex Excel spreadsheets into SAP. The idea behind BRF+ is appealing, but after working with it closely, I’ve come to some conclusions that might surprise you.</p><p></p><h3>What is SAP BRF+?</h3><p>BRF+ is a tool designed to let business users<strong> define and manage business rules without constantly relying on IT</strong>. It’s supposed to make updating and maintaining rules easier, moving logic from deep inside ABAP code into a space where non-technical users can tweak things themselves.</p><blockquote><p>In theory, it’s a smart move—giving business users more control over the rules that impact them daily. But theory and practice don’t always align.</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>A Bit of History</h3><p>SAP introduced BRF+ to <strong>make business logic more accessible</strong>. The goal was to let business users adjust processes on their own without calling IT for every little change. Whether it’s compliance checks, financial processing, or other rule-heavy areas, BRF+ is supposed to simplify things.</p><p>The vision was clear: empower the business to manage rules, freeing up IT for more complex tasks. SAP has used BRF+ in various places, but the most decent implementation I’ve seen was for outbound document handling. It worked well there, but outside of that, I haven’t seen much to get excited about. </p><blockquote><p>Honestly, I think even SAP realizes the tool isn’t as impactful as they hoped.</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>My Experience: Excel Migration Project</h3><p>I was part of a project where we had <strong>to move complex Excel spreadsheets into SAP</strong>. These spreadsheets weren’t simple—they had intricate formulas and decision rules that had been developed over years. We needed to replicate that functionality in SAP, and BRF+ was the chosen tool.</p><p>I handled the design and development, translating all those Excel formulas into BRF+ logic. Technically,<strong> BRF+ did what we needed</strong>. It allowed us <strong>to map out the rules and execute decisions effectively</strong>. </p><blockquote><p>But that’s only half the story.</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>The Problem with Business User Adoption</h3><p>One of BRF+’s key promises is empowering business users to manage their own rules. But here’s where things fell apart for us. <strong>The key users didn’t really embrace BRF+. </strong>The interface, while not overly technical, still required a level of understanding and detail they weren’t interested in.</p><p>They ended up coming to IT for most adjustments, which defeated the purpose. <strong>What was supposed to reduce IT involvement ended up requiring almost as much coordination between business and IT as before!</strong> The learning curve for BRF+ was just too steep for users who<strong> didn’t want to deal with that level of complexity.</strong></p><p></p><h3>From a Developer’s Perspective</h3><p>As a developer, I found BRF+ interesting. It’s flexible, and in theory, it’s a great way to handle dynamic business logic. It does have its place, especially in situations where rules are constantly changing.</p><p>But there were times I thought, “<em>Wouldn’t this have been easier in ABAP or Fiori?</em>” For many of the things we needed to do, the extra effort to set up BRF+ didn’t feel justified. It added complexity without giving us enough in return. In hindsight,<strong> I could have done most of the work faster in ABAP.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Why BRF+ Won’t Become Popular</h3><p>In my opinion, BRF+ is <strong>NOT going to become a widely-used tool in the SAP ecosystem</strong>. The main issue is that it doesn’t really deliver on its promise of making things easier for business users.</p><p></p><h3>Pros and Cons of BRF+</h3><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><p>BRF+ works well with BOPF, letting you test things locally and document rules easily. No need for custom configuration tables—everything is handled inside BRF+, making it easier to maintain.</p></li><li><p><strong>"Black Box" After Setup</strong>: Once the rules are built, BRF+ functions like a black box. You can easily transport, reuse, and maintain them without having to touch the code constantly.</p></li><li><p>A handy feature is the ability to search for objects within the BRF+ catalog, saving you time when managing large sets of rules.</p></li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Steep Learning Curve</strong>: While BRF+ promises to empower business users, its complexity can make adoption difficult, especially for those without a technical background.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Concerns</strong>: Large or complex rules can slow down processes. It’s crucial to keep an eye on performance, especially in high-volume environments.</p></li><li><p>Despite its goal of reducing IT dependency, business users often still need IT help for more advanced adjustments.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>My Thoughts on BRF+ Resources</h3><p>When I first dove into BRF+, I read the book <em>BRFplus—Business Rule Management for ABAP Applications</em> by Carsten Ziegler and Thomas Albrecht. To be honest, I didn’t find it all that helpful. If you’re trying to learn BRF+, you’re better off reading an introductory article and jumping into a project right away. The hands-on experience will teach you more than the book ever could.</p><hr><p>BRF+ is an interesting tool, but it’s not the revolution SAP might have hoped it would be. It works well in some specific scenarios, especially where rules are frequently changing and need quick adjustments. <strong>But for most standard business processes, it feels like overkill.</strong></p><p>In my experience, BRF+ <strong>complicates things more than it simplifies them</strong>. If you’re dealing with dynamic, constantly evolving business rules, it might be worth exploring. But for most projects, sticking with ABAP or Fiori will probably save you time and headaches.</p></div>
