  <div><p>If you’re dealing with goods moving across borders within the EU, <strong>Intrastat reporting</strong> is something you need to get right. SAP helps you automate this process by pulling the necessary data directly from your system, reducing manual work. Here’s how <strong>Intrastat declarations</strong> work in SAP, step by step, along with key features.</p><h3>Key Features of Intrastat in SAP</h3><h3>1. Managing Provider Information</h3><p>Before you can generate Intrastat reports, you need to provide your company’s <strong>provider-of-information data</strong>. This is required by your country’s statistics authority and needs to be maintained in the system. Think of this as setting up your company’s profile for Intrastat reporting.</p><p></p><h3>2. Creating Intrastat Declarations</h3><p>Each month, you’ll be required to generate Intrastat reports for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Receipts</strong>: Goods your company receives from other EU countries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dispatches</strong>: Goods your company ships to other EU countries.</p></li></ul><p>You can manage these declarations directly in SAP, where the system helps you gather the required statistical data, ensuring all cross-border movements are properly reported.</p><p></p><h3>3. Selecting Dispatches and Customer Returns</h3><p>For goods that leave your company, SAP selects relevant data from <strong>billing documents</strong> to generate the Intrastat report. This includes not only standard dispatches but also <strong>customer returns</strong>—so any goods sent back to you are accounted for.</p><p></p><h3>4. Selecting Receipts and Returns to Suppliers</h3><p>For incoming goods, SAP pulls data from <strong>purchase orders</strong> and <strong>intercompany billing documents</strong>. This data includes <strong>receipts</strong> and <strong>returns to suppliers</strong>, ensuring both the goods coming in and going back out are accurately reported.</p><p></p><h3>How It’s Handled in Different EU Countries</h3><p>SAP has specific setups for handling Intrastat in several countries, including Austria, Italy, Germany, Spain, and many others. Notably, in <strong>Italy</strong>, the system is also set up to track <strong>services</strong>, as this is required in addition to goods.</p><h3>SAP S/4HANA and Intrastat</h3><p>If you’re using <strong>S/4HANA</strong>, there’s a shift from the older ERP foreign trade functionality. Here’s what’s different:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Foreign trade/customs tabs</strong> that existed in ERP are no longer available in S/4HANA.</p></li><li><p>Instead, S/4HANA uses a new international trade approach, with everything now managed through the <strong>Fiori apps</strong> like <strong>Manage Intrastat Declarations</strong> or transaction /ECRS/RP_EDIT.</p></li><li><p>Tables like <strong>EIKP</strong> and <strong>EIPO</strong> (which used to store data) are no longer updated in S/4HANA. Now, all changes related to Intrastat are made via the new Fiori apps.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>Commodity Codes in S/4HANA</h3><ul><li><p>From S/4HANA release 1909 onwards, you can no longer manage commodity codes through traditional GUI transactions like <strong>/SAPSLL/CLSNR_01</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Instead, SAP has introduced a Fiori app called <strong>Manage Commodity Codes</strong> for handling commodity codes. The old method of assigning commodity codes at the material master level has been replaced by apps like <strong>Classify Products</strong> and <strong>Re-Classify Products</strong>.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>Common Intrastat Challenges and FAQs</h3><ol><li><p>If you’re dealing with <strong>supplementary units of measure</strong> and can’t edit them, this feature has been updated. As of S/4HANA 1809, supplementary units of measure require mapping with customs units.</p></li><li><p>For Intrastat reporting, the country of origin is usually taken from the <strong>batch master data</strong>. If no batch exists, it defaults to the <strong>material master</strong>. As of <strong>S/4HANA 2020</strong>, this information is also stored at the <strong>delivery item level</strong>.</p></li><li><p>In Intrastat receipts, the region is taken from the receiving plant. For dispatches, it checks the region of origin, or, if goods were produced elsewhere, from the delivering plant.</p></li><li><p>SAP does not allow multiple commodity codes for the same product in one country. However, you can manage <strong>end-use functionality</strong> for different classifications as needed.</p></li><li><p>If you’re encountering errors like "You cannot change a declaration with status released," it typically means the job has already processed a declaration for that period (e.g., dispatches). You’ll need to cancel the released status and re-run the job.</p></li></ol><p></p><h3>Why Use S/4HANA’s International Trade Module?</h3><p>The <strong>International Trade</strong> module in S/4HANA offers several benefits over the older foreign trade setup:</p><ul><li><p>Better support for more countries (26 countries in S/4HANA vs. 16 in ERP).</p></li><li><p>Streamlined user interface with options for mass updates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple users</strong> can work simultaneously, speeding up the reporting process.</p></li><li><p>It reduces data redundancy, as plant-level commodity code assignment is no longer necessary.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>Where to Find More Information</h3><p>For more detailed documentation on <strong>Intrastat</strong> in S/4HANA, you can check the SAP Help Portal. Simply search for "International Trade," and you’ll find a section dedicated to <strong>Intrastat</strong>. You can also explore <strong>SAP Notes</strong> like:</p><ul><li><p><strong>2576322</strong>: Finding documentation for international trade in S/4HANA.</p></li><li><p><strong>2402490</strong>: Managing foreign trade data after migrating to S/4HANA.</p></li></ul></div>
