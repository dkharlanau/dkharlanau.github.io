  <div><p><strong>Not every company needs SAP MDG</strong> / or SAP MDG implementation.</p><p>You start an MDG project when your business is <strong>big enough and complex enough</strong> that bad data starts to block growth and cost serious money.</p><ul><li><p>You have many countries and regions, each with different ways to create or change customer data.</p></li><li><p>You work with thousands of vendors, and you see duplicate payments or fraud risks.</p></li><li><p>You run global supply chains, and wrong material or plant data stops production or deliveries.</p></li><li><p>You want to move to S/4HANA, but your old data is too messy to migrate.</p></li></ul><p>In these situations, "<strong>fixing data later</strong>" no longer works. Errors create <strong>big legal and financial risks</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Why do we even need SAP MDG? What are the real reasons to do this project?</h3><p>There isn’t one simple answer — it depends on your<strong> business pain points</strong>. But here are some strong use cases that show why companies decide to start MDG.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Shanying International Holdings</strong> — unified data across three business units using SAP MDG, cut material data volume by 57%, and increased transparency. <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories/shanying.html" target="_blank">Read this business case for SAP MDG</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Adani Group</strong> — implemented SAP MDG on S/4HANA to manage master data across nine ERP systems; cleaned 1.6 million records and improved productivity by 15–20%. <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories/adani.html" target="_blank">Read this business case for SAP MDG</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Döhler</strong> — global ingredients manufacturer using SAP MDG to harmonize master data and improve time-to-market. <a href="https://www.sap.com/netherlands/documents/2025/02/2a6f3c75-f47e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank"><strong>Read this business case for SAP MDG</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>These are strong business cases. But MDG alone is <strong>not enough</strong> — you still need clear ownership, strong governance rules, and solid change management. Without that, MDG will <strong>just be another expensive system that looks good on slides but creates more frustration on the ground</strong>. </p><pre></pre><hr><h2>Content, what is covered</h2><p><strong>What is MDG really about?</strong> Super simple explanation + reference to DAMA-DMBOK (why data is an asset, not just IT records).</p><p><strong>Project chapter</strong></p><ul><li><p>Key points to plan, documents, ownership, realistic timelines.</p></li><li><p>What can easily go wrong: lack of ownership, weak executive support, poor change management.</p></li><li><p>Why user training and early involvement are critical if you want MDG to actually work.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Implementation &amp; Design</strong></p><ul><li><p>Designing master data objects (BP, materials, vendors), extending fields, custom entities.</p></li><li><p>Defining workflows, approvals, validations — flexible but requires serious design effort.</p></li><li><p>Once approved, data must move to ERP, CRM, and other systems. Different technical options, each with complexity.</p></li><li><p>MDG helps clean legacy data and run big updates across many records.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>What is MDG really about? (explained super simply)</h2><p>MDG stands for <strong>Master Data Governance</strong>. In simple words, MDG is about finally taking control of your most important business data — customers, vendors, materials, plants, and even your custom master data like internal codes or product hierarchies and etc. </p><p>On top of that, MDG lets you <strong>consolidate data from different sources</strong>, clean it up, and create one single, trusted version before you push it into your main systems. You always know who created it, when, why, and where it goes. This is especially important when you have <strong>many systems using the same data</strong>. Instead of each system living its own life (and creating chaos), you get one controlled flow.</p><p>With MDG, you can also<strong> consolidate and</strong> <strong>mass change data</strong> when something big happens — like changing tax numbers, updating a whole product line, or merging company units after an acquisition.</p><p><strong>Reference to standards: DAMA-DMBOK </strong></p><p>MDG follows global best practices for data governance, which are described in <a href="https://dama.org/learning-resources/dama-data-management-body-of-knowledge-dmbok/" target="_blank">DAMA-DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge)</a>. This standard shows that master data must be treated<strong> as a real business asset, with clear ownership, strict validation rules</strong>, <strong>and full lifecycle control</strong>.</p><p>I always tell: <strong>read this standard first</strong>. SAP doesn’t fully cover everything from DAMA-DMBOK out of the box. You need <strong>to understand the principles yourself </strong>— how ownership works, why data is a product, how lifecycle rules should be built. If you don’t know the basics, you might think MDG will magically fix everything. <strong>It won’t.</strong></p><hr><h2>What to know about MDG as a project</h2><h3>Must have documents you need for SAP MDG Project</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Project charter</strong> — <strong>why are we doing MDG (??)</strong>, what are the business goals, what value do we expect (<em>not just “clean data,” but also lower operational risk, smoother S/4 migration, faster market entry</em>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Business case &amp; scope document</strong> — which domains (BP, vendors, materials, etc.), which objects, which countries.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-dama-dmbok-describes-data-governance-within-sandy-bradbury-cbp8f/" target="_blank"><strong>Data governance policy</strong></a> — who owns which data, who approves, who maintains it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Solution design (high-level + detailed)</strong> — system architecture, integrations, data flows, where validations happen, how enrichment works, migration strategy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Process flows / diagrams</strong> — clear steps: create → validate → approve → distribute.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test strategy &amp; migration plan</strong> — how to clean legacy data, test cases, who leads <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/user-acceptance-testing-uat.html" target="_blank">UAT</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cutover &amp; rollout plan</strong> — how to go live: <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/big-bang-phased-approach-advantages-disadvantages-4820" target="_blank">big bang or phased approach</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Change management plan</strong> — how to train users, prepare them <a href="https://www.akana.com/blog/data-first" target="_blank">to think "data first."</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Risk log &amp; mitigation plan</strong> — key risks: no ownership, weak sponsorship, poor integration.</p></li></ul><hr><h3>Typical timelines</h3><p>Very rough, depends on company size and scope:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Preparation &amp; analysis</strong> — 2–3 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design &amp; build</strong> — 4–6 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing &amp; data migration</strong> — 2–3 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Go-live &amp; hypercare</strong> — 1–2 months.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>A serious MDG project usually takes <strong>9–12 months end-to-end</strong>. If combined with S/4 migration, it can go up to 18+ months.</p></blockquote><hr><p>One thing I always tell: <strong>don’t just talk to sales teams — talk to the actual people who will build and run your project</strong>. Set up sessions, ask them real questions, understand how they think and solve problems. The company is important, but in the end,<strong> it’s the team that will make or break your project.</strong></p><hr><h2>SAP MDG Implementation </h2><h3>Deployment Options (my view)</h3><p>You have two main options for SAP MDG: <strong>Hub</strong> and <strong>Co-Deployment</strong>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hub</strong> → <strong>separate system just for master data</strong>. Clean start, more flexibility, supports all data domains. Needs extra setup and cost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Co-Deployment</strong> → inside your main S/4HANA system. Easier, cheaper, <strong>no data replication</strong>. But usually only works well for <strong>Business Partner (BP)</strong> domain.</p></li></ul><p>In <strong>public cloud</strong>, today you can really <strong>only do BP governance</strong> (<a href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/sap-master-data-governance/understanding-cloud-ready-mode_ebb0cee8-0f4d-4e71-97f5-e8250d300ffb" target="_blank">cloud-ready mode</a>). It’s fast and modern, but fewer options and less control.</p><p></p><p></p><hr><h3>About the author</h3><p>I work at <a href="https://www.epam.com/services/partners/sap" target="_blank">EPAM Systems</a> as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkharlanau/" target="_blank">Senior SAP consultant</a> and system analyst, focused S/4 / MDG transformation projects. If you have questions or need support with MDG project, feel free to reach out — I’m happy to share my perspective or connect you with the right experts at EPAM.</p><hr><p>In addition, some resources you will find really helpful</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/master-data-governance/how-to" target="_blank">How-to Information for SAP Master Data Governance</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/my-support/systems-installations/system-measurement/engine-self-declaration-product-measurement/8180-8185-sap-master-data-governance-en.pdf" target="_blank">SAP Master Data Governance Measurement (Classic &amp; S/4HANA)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3387540/E" target="_blank">3387540 - MDG-BP/C/S: Upgrade and Conversion to SAP S/4HANA 2023</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3374998/E" target="_blank">3374998 - Functional Restrictions in MDG for Material on SAP S/4HANA 2023</a></p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>3245531 - MDG-M: Usage of MDG Tools and Processes</strong></p><p>Using Central Governance for bulk updates quickly hits a wall. Change Requests don’t scale — anything over 100 materials becomes painful. If you need to touch thousands of records, use <strong>SAP MDG: Consolidation and Mass Processing</strong>. It’s built for this — supports parallel runs, and performs way better.</p><p>But watch out: the number of objects per process is hardcoded. If your records are big (like materials with 300+ plant views), you may need to redefine the adapter class. <strong>Activation options:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use <strong>Direct Activation</strong> for clean records. It’s fast and writes straight to DB.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>Change Request Activation</strong> only for error cases — it routes records to staging so users can fix them. Never auto-approve these. SAP explicitly warns against that.</p></li></ul><p></p></div>
