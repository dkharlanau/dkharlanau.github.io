  <div><p>I've been working in SAP development for more than 10 years, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: <strong>testing saves you every time</strong>. Whether you’re dealing with ABAP, Fiori, or other SAP frameworks, testing isn’t optional—it’s critical. Over the years, I’ve seen projects fail or get delayed simply because someone thought skipping or rushing through testing was a good idea. Spoiler: it never is.</p><h3>Why Testing in SAP Is So Important</h3><p>SAP systems are highly integrated, and even the smallest mistake can have a ripple effect across various modules. A missed logic error in ABAP or an overlooked integration detail in a Fiori app can cause massive downstream problems. The bigger the system, the bigger the stakes. </p><blockquote><p>Testing is about more than just making sure the system functions; it’s about catching all the small details that ensure everything runs smoothly. If you don't catch them, your users definitely will.</p></blockquote><h3>My Approach: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</h3><p>For me, testing isn’t something I do after the fact—it’s baked into my development process. I’m a big fan of <strong>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</strong>. Instead of coding first and testing later, I start by defining <strong>how the system should behave.</strong> </p><blockquote><p>What’s the expected outcome? What are the key behaviors the user is going to rely on? Once I have that, I start building with those behaviors in mind.</p></blockquote><p>Why BDD? Because it forces you to think about the system holistically, <strong>from the user's perspective.</strong> It makes testing part of the creative process, not just a step at the end. You’re building quality in from day one, and it’s a mindset that can be applied to any SAP development—whether it's ABAP logic, Fiori UI elements, or integration points.</p><h3>Keep a Test Log: Small Detail, Big Impact</h3><p>Here’s something a lot of people don’t do enough of: <strong>keeping a test log</strong>. I can’t emphasize this enough—logging everything you’re testing, every outcome, <strong>and every little unexpected behavior can save you so much time later. </strong></p><p>Testing isn’t just about running through your scenarios; it’s about documenting what worked, what didn’t, and what needs further investigation.</p><p>This log becomes incredibly valuable when things go wrong, and they always do at some point ( OR EVEN just to remember what you have DONE ). It gives you a clear record of what was tested, what assumptions were made, and how the system behaved at different stages.  </p><h3>Analyzing Solutions Quickly in ABAP</h3><p>One of the perks of ABAP development, and SAP in general, is the ability to quickly navigate between different parts of the solution. Whether I’m working with complex logic in a program <strong>or debugging a weird issue (!!)</strong>, the ability to jump around and analyze different layers of the solution is a huge advantage.</p><p>You can trace logic in real time, check how the system interacts with other modules, and immediately pinpoint where things went wrong. This makes the testing phase far more efficient because you’re not working in the dark—you can follow the flow and catch issues as they appear, fixing them in the process.</p><blockquote><p>But here’s the kicker: this efficiency only works when you have a <strong>deep understanding of what you’re building and testing</strong>. </p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Save Time on Testing by Testing Smart</h3><p><strong>Testing is time-consuming</strong>, but it’s a lot less time-consuming than fixing broken code in production. To save time on testing, you need to <strong>test SMART</strong>. That means <strong>focusing on the parts that matter most</strong>, understanding the risks involved, and prioritizing the most important tests.</p><p>This is where deep knowledge of the system pays off. When you<strong> understand the core business processes, system architecture, and potential failure points</strong>, you can zero in on the most critical areas to test.</p><p></p><h3>Test Everything, Not Just ABAP</h3><p>It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that testing is only for the code side of things. But in SAP development, everything needs testing—integrations, user interfaces, data flows, and even how the system interacts with external systems like third-party APIs or legacy software.</p><p>I’ve seen projects where the ABAP logic worked perfectly, <strong>but the integrations fell apart, or the Fiori UI didn’t behave the way it should</strong>. Testing needs to cover <strong>every part of the system</strong>. SAP environments are connected by nature, and a bug in one module can mess up another if not caught early.</p><p></p><h3>Don’t Rush It—Take Testing Seriously</h3><p>A lot of teams rush through the testing phase, either because <strong>they’re eager to meet deadlines</strong> or they think everything is working fine after the initial build. </p><p>In my experience, rushing testing is a recipe for disaster. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Testing is like insurance</strong>—it may feel tedious upfront, but when problems arise, you’ll be thankful for the time you spent on it.</p></blockquote><p>The more detailed and thorough your tests, the fewer surprises you’ll have when the system goes live. And trust me, it’s always better to deal with bugs during testing than having to scramble after users start reporting them.</p></div>
