    "definition": "Separate an interfering part or property from an object, or single out only the necessary part."

  "problem_understanding": {
    "core_contradiction": "We need the system to be reliable and standardized, but one volatile part keeps forcing exceptions and complexity everywhere.",
    "why_this_hurts": "If a single 'messy' concern is embedded inside the core, it contaminates architecture, increases defect rate, and makes every change expensive.",
    "typical_signals": [
      "one special case changes many components",
      "core code contains many 'if customer X / country Y / legacy Z' branches",
      "releases are blocked by a single integration or rule set",

  "solution_logic": {
    "core_idea": "Identify the volatile/interfering part and extract it behind a boundary.",
    "key_rule": "Keep the core clean; move volatility to the edges (adapters, plugins, rules engines, separate services).",
    "how_it_resolves_the_contradiction": "The stable core remains standardized and testable, while the isolated part can evolve independently without spreading complexity."
  },
  "application_patterns": {
    "consulting": [
      "separate 'governance rules' from 'local exceptions' into a controlled exception process",
      "extract one risky topic into a focused workstream with clear SLA and decision rights",
      "create a 'policy layer' (principles/standards) and an 'exception layer' (approved deviations)"
    ],
    "software_engineering": [
      "extract feature flags/experiments out of core logic",
      "isolate third-party integrations via adapters",
      "move complex conditional logic into a rules engine or configuration module",

    "architecture": [
      "anti-corruption layer around legacy systems",
      "strangler pattern: extract and replace parts gradually",
      "separate read models (reporting/search) from write model (transaction core)"
    ],
    "enterprise_sap": [
      "take custom enhancements out of the core flow: use BAdIs/user exits as boundary points, not scattered ABAP changes",
      "isolate country-specific or customer-specific rules in configuration / BRF+ instead of code branches",
      "separate master data governance (MDG validation/workflow) from distribution (replication adapters)"
    ]
  },
  "anti_patterns": [
    "extracting without a clear contract (new spaghetti outside the core)",
    "moving complexity but keeping shared database tables and hidden coupling",
    "creating a 'special-case service' that becomes a dumping ground"
  ],
  "usage_guidance": {
    "use_when": [
      "one volatile module causes most incidents or delays",
      "exceptions keep multiplying inside the core",
      "integration complexity dominates delivery time",
      "you need to modernize gradually without big-bang rewrites"
    ],
    "do_not_use_when": [
      "the extracted part is not actually volatile (you misdiagnosed the cause)",

  "diagnostic_questions": [
    "Which 10% of components cause 80% of change pain or incidents?",
    "What part forces the most exceptions and branching logic in the core?",
    "If we could isolate one dependency, which one would reduce coordination the most?"
  ],
  "example": {
    "before": "Core transaction service contains many customer-specific conditions and tightly embedded third-party API calls.",
    "after": "Core service exposes a clean contract; customer-specific behavior is a plugin; third-party calls are isolated in an adapter with retries and monitoring."
