The Neubrutalist system lives on three pillars: declarative data, componentised sections, and machine-readable exports.

1. **Declarative data** routes all repeatable copy through `_data` so homepage edits never mean touching HTML.
2. **Componentised sections** inside `_includes/sections` make each block reusable across landing pages.
3. **Machine-readable exports** in `/ai` mirror the content model so copilots can brief themselves before helping prospects.

Future updates should continue this pattern: describe content in data, reference it from a dedicated include, and emit a JSON or YAML twin in `ai/` for automation hooks.
