I am a System Analyst and Senior SAP consultant at EPAM Systems. When sponsors feel Order-to-Cash, Procure-to-Pay, or custom integrations are leaking value, I run structured audits to expose where the flow breaks and how to fix it. The goal: **restore control, shorten lead times, and keep S/4HANA portable.**

## Audit focus areas

### 1. Order-to-Cash (O2C)
- Analyse order fulfilment stages from intake to billing, including ATP/aATP, pricing, delivery creation, and billing completion.
- Inspect backlog drivers: blocked deliveries, incomplete billing docs, idoc rejections, credit management holds.
- Map incident history to specific process steps and quantify revenue impact.
- Evaluate extension footprint (user exits, BAdIs, custom tables) for clean-core alignment and documentation.

### 2. Procure-to-Pay (P2P)
- Review sourcing, purchase order automation, goods receipt, invoice verification, and payment release.
- Identify manual interventions (parked invoices, GR/IR imbalances, unplanned delivery costs) and their root causes.
- Check vendor master governance, approval workflow design, and segregation of duties (SoD) risks.
- Validate how custom fields, forms, or partner add-ons impact compliance and audit trails.

### 3. Integration & custom developments
- Inventory interfaces across Idoc, AIF, PI/PO, Integration Suite, APIs, and event mesh.
- Assess logging, monitoring, replay, and idempotency patterns — highlight where observability is missing.
- Evaluate custom code quality, transport hygiene, and test coverage for high-change components.
- Confirm decision records (ADRs) exist for critical build vs. buy choices and platform selection.

## Diagnostic toolkit

1. **Process mining & logs** — SAP application logs, CDS views, and change docs to trace actual process flows.
2. **KEDB and incident clustering** — group repeat issues by process stage, integration partner, or plant.
3. **Code review matrix** — catalogue enhancements, extensions, and wrappers with portability scoring.
4. **Control heatmap** — visualise SoD gaps, manual overrides, and compliance breakpoints.
5. **Observability scan** — measure alert coverage, runbook quality, and MTTR trends.

## Engagement flow

1. **Kick-off & scoping (Week 0-1)**
   - Stakeholder interviews across business, IT, and operations.
   - Collect baseline metrics (OTIF, DPO, backlog age, automation rate).
   - Confirm data sources (logs, transport history, change docs).

2. **Discovery & analysis (Weeks 1-3)**
   - Run process mining queries, interface traces, and code reviews.
   - Catalogue findings in an audit backlog with severity, owner, and remediation options.
   - Validate hypotheses with frontline users and AMS teams.

3. **Playback & prioritisation (Week 4)**
   - Present heatmap of risks and opportunities by domain (O2C, P2P, Integration).
   - Align on remediation sprints: clean-core refactoring, observability rollout, control hardening.
   - Produce guardrails (ADRs, design briefs) so fixes stay portable and auditable.

4. **Follow-through (Weeks 5+)**
   - Pair with delivery teams to embed guardrails and prevention metrics.
   - Set up monitoring dashboards and MTTR/lead-time tracking.
   - Provide an executive scorecard for ongoing governance.

## Outcomes to expect

- **Faster cash conversion:** fewer billing backlogs, smoother deliveries, cleaner returns handling.
- **Stronger compliance:** SoD, approval workflows, and audit evidence brought under consistent governance.
- **Lower run-rate:** reduction in repeat incidents, manual retries, and partner escalations.
- **Portable architecture:** clean-core remediation plans and integration guardrails ready for future programmes.

### Working together

Use this audit when you suspect the process is slowing growth, when audit findings keep returning, or when custom code feels like a black box. I partner with AMS, product, and compliance leads to turn findings into measurable improvements.
