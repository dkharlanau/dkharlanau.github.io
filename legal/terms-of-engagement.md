# Terms of Engagement

As a System Analyst and Senior SAP consultant at EPAM Systems, these terms outline how I structure SAP consulting collaborations. When a project is executed through EPAM Systems, the EPAM master services agreement or statement of work takes precedence.

## Scope and deliverables

- Each engagement is governed by a written statement of work or proposal that defines objectives, deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria.
- Changes to scope, timeline, or budget require written approval from both parties.
- Prototype or advisory artefacts produced during discovery are not production-ready unless explicitly stated.

## Fees and invoicing

- Pricing may be time-and-materials, milestone-based, or fixed-fee depending on the agreed model.
- Invoices are issued according to the payment schedule in the statement of work and are payable within 30 calendar days unless otherwise specified.
- Expenses are billable only when pre-approved and supported by receipts.

## Collaboration commitments

- You will designate a primary stakeholder empowered to review deliverables and provide timely feedback.
- I will provide weekly progress updates, risk logs, and backlog visibility to avoid surprises.
- Decisions that affect programme risk or compliance will be recorded in shared documentation.

## Intellectual property

- Final deliverables, documentation, and code created specifically for your engagement become your property upon full payment, subject to any third-party licensing terms.
- Reusable accelerators, frameworks, or methodologies developed prior to the engagement remain my intellectual property or EPAM Systems’ property, while you retain a non-exclusive licence to use them within the agreed solution.

## Confidentiality

- Both parties must protect confidential information shared during the engagement and use it only for project purposes.
- Confidentiality obligations survive the conclusion of the engagement.

## Non-solicitation

- Neither party will solicit or hire the other’s personnel who are involved in the engagement for a period of 12 months after project completion, unless mutually agreed.

## Liability

- Liability is limited to direct damages up to the total fees paid for the applicable engagement, and excludes indirect or consequential losses.
- For EPAM-led engagements, liability terms defined in the EPAM contract apply.

## Governing law

- Unless otherwise agreed, engagements delivered directly by me are governed by the laws of the European Union member state where services are rendered.
- EPAM Systems engagements follow the governing law stipulated in the EPAM contract.
