# Professional Code of Conduct

As a System Analyst and Senior SAP consultant with EPAM Systems, I operate under a consulting discipline that keeps SAP programmes predictable and partners protected. These principles apply whether we work directly or through EPAM Systems.

## Client trust and confidentiality

- Respect contractual and regulatory boundaries for every engagement.
- Safeguard production, commercial, and personal data using EPAM Systems controls and client-specific policies.
- Escalate risk promptly when confidentiality or compliance could be compromised.

## Ethical delivery

- Set realistic expectations for scope, cost, and timelines before work begins.
- Surface blockers immediately, together with mitigation options or corrective plans.
- Decline assignments that conflict with existing commitments or ethical standards.

## Collaboration etiquette

- Maintain transparent communication channels, including decision logs and meeting notes.
- Credit contributions from client teams, partners, and fellow consultants.
- Foster inclusive working sessions where stakeholders can challenge assumptions safely.

## Security and compliance posture

- Follow EPAM Systems security baselines, including MFA, device hardening, and least-privilege access.
- Adhere to client identity and access management requirements when acting as an extension of their teams.
- Document data flows and retention for AI or automation components before implementation.

## Continuous improvement

- Pair programme retrospectives with concrete follow-up actions.
- Invest in ongoing SAP, integration, and AI upskilling so advice remains current.
- Encourage feedback loops from sponsors and delivery teams to refine how we collaborate.
