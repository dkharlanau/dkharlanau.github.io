# Accessibility Statement

I am a System Analyst and Senior SAP consultant at EPAM Systems, and I aim to make this website—and the solutions I deliver—usable by as many people as possible.

## Site experience

- Built with semantic HTML, keyboard-focus styles, and responsive layouts that adapt to different screens.
- Colour palette meets or exceeds WCAG AA contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
- Skip-link navigation is available for screen reader and keyboard users.

## Ongoing improvements

- Regularly review pages with automated testing tools (e.g., WAVE, axe) and manual checks.
- Incorporate feedback from users encountering accessibility issues; please report concerns through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkharlanau) or your EPAM Systems engagement manager.
- Accessibility requirements are captured in statements of work so deliverables meet client compliance targets.

## Third-party content

- Embedded documents or assets hosted by partners may have their own accessibility provisions. I collaborate with partner teams to address gaps where possible.

Accessibility is an ongoing commitment. If you need content in an alternative format or spot an issue, reach out and I will respond within two business days.
