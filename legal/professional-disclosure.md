# Professional Disclosure

## Employment

- I am employed as a System Analyst and Senior SAP Order-to-Cash Consultant at EPAM Systems.
- When an engagement is contracted through EPAM Systems, the company’s governance, compliance, and security frameworks apply.
- Independent collaborations are scoped transparently so there is no conflict with EPAM Systems responsibilities.

## Affiliations and certifications

- Active member of EPAM Systems’ SAP community of practice and architecture review forums.
- Participant in AI and observability working groups focused on enterprise SAP landscapes.

## Independence and conflict management

- I disclose potential conflicts of interest before agreeing to new work and will decline opportunities that overlap with current client engagements or EPAM Systems policies.
- Technology recommendations are based on programme fit, not commercial incentives. I do not accept referral fees or vendor commissions.

## Communication channels

- Use LinkedIn for business enquiries, partnership discussions, or reference checks.
- For EPAM Systems clients, official communication should flow through your account manager or the EPAM project workspace.
