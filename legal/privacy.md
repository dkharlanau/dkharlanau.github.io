# Privacy Notice

As a System Analyst and Senior SAP consultant at EPAM Systems, I respect the privacy of visitors and partners. This notice explains what limited personal data is collected through this site and how it is used.

## Site visits

- This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect standard log data such as IP address and browser information for security and analytics purposes.
- No tracking cookies or third-party advertising scripts are deployed.
- Aggregated traffic metrics from GitHub are used only to understand high-level engagement (for example, which pages are most helpful).

## Contact channels

- When you reach out via LinkedIn or Calendly, the information you submit is used solely to respond to your enquiry and coordinate the engagement.
- For EPAM Systems projects, your data is handled in accordance with EPAM’s privacy policies and contractual commitments.

## AI-ready downloads

- Machine-readable assets (JSON, YAML, TXT) are provided for transparency and automation. They contain professional profile data that I choose to share publicly.
- If you incorporate these assets into internal systems, you are responsible for ensuring your usage complies with applicable privacy, security, and retention requirements.

## Data retention

- Communications related to potential or active engagements are retained for up to 24 months to maintain historical context, unless you request earlier deletion (subject to legal retention requirements).
- Documentation generated during paid work is stored within EPAM Systems’ or the client’s governance framework.

## Your rights

- You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal data held about you by contacting me directly at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkharlanau) or through EPAM Systems support channels.
- If you believe your data has been mishandled, please reach out immediately so it can be addressed.

## Updates

- This notice is reviewed periodically as regulations and tooling evolve. The latest version is always available on this page.
